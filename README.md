# About me
Hi, I'm Hussain Alelaiwi, a 2nd Year Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Student at the University of Birmingham

I am passionate about combining AI and systems programming to build efficient, innovative solutions. I enjoy creating projects from scratch, focusing on optimization, parallelization, and deep understanding of underlying technologies.

# Current Projects

1. Information theory for Exploration-Explotation tradeoff in bandit learning with delayed rewards. 

# Technical overview

- Languages: C, C++, Java, Python, Javascript (Angular), and Haskell.
- Fields of interest: Machine Learning, Optimizations, Bandit learning, RL with delayed rewards, and Information theory in ML.
- Tools: GitHub, Git CLI, VS code, Visual Studio, IntelliJ, PyCharm, and Clion (Jetbrains IDEs). 

# Goals:
1. Dive deeper into Neural computations, NLP, advanced Bandit-Learning, and Evolutionary computation.
2. Research how Information Theory can be ussed in ML to measure uncertainty.
3. Learn more about the underlying mathmatical background and intution of Machine learning algorithms.
4. Learn more about real world work environment and programming teams.
